Is the accused trying to tamper with the jury assigned to his case, or is there something more sinister going on?[return][return]This well-written novel follows Bea as she solves the mystery that she stumbled upon, forcing her to revisit her own personal history in the process. I enjoyed reading this book, mixing classic crime fiction tropes with unsual characters and some unexpected plot twists. I liked Bea’s character and I hope that we will get to read more about her adventures.",

Ever since he lit the pyre that burned Joan of Arc in 1431, he keeps reincarnating, forced by the Curse into a eternity of miserable lives to atone for his sin. But this time, Marvin saw something he's never seen before: a woman on a TV reality show says she's a reincarnation of Joan of Arc. Convinced this is his way to seek the forgiveness he needs to end the Curse. As he sets off to travel to Los Angeles and meet her, Marvin meets two other drifters, each seeking their own version of forgiveness...[return][return]This is the second book by Keith Rosson that I've read, and I enjoyed it even more than the first one. This story takes a decidedly original take on reincarnation and atonement, and tells it through a hard to love but ultimately quite touching set of characters. A great read.",

It is not an overly optimistic book, the author stresses that new generations (starting with that of his own children) will live a dramatically different life unless the population as a whole undergoes drastic lifestyle changes. However, Freeman also highlights possible actions to mitigate ecological impact, by his own example (one that is in turn inspired by a relative who was a pioneer of the American conservation movement) and ending the book with advice on how readers can help prepare a better future for their children. Not only is this an excellent book for whoever cares about the environment and wants to learn more about practical actions to take better care of it, but it might even speak to those who don't feel that concerned, as Freeman does an excellent job explaining why a healthy salmon, or beaver, or frog is important to the whole community.[return]The copy I reviewed was an advance reading copy and therefore was missing some of the final illustrations, but I often wished the book included a map of the revitalized area, which would have helped visualize the narrative better.",

      "notes" : "In Reagan's America, the Cold War is a palpable threat. But as the year 1983 nears to an end, the impending nuclear doom of the mutual assured destruction doctrine isn't the only shadow to darken the small coastal town of Riptide, Oregon. Mutilated animals start appearing, ancient remains are found that bring back memories of a violent past, before the town is shocked by the grueling death of a young man. Battling with demons on their own, the local sheriff and his deputies soon find that the key to what is happening might not be found among the living... And the rain never stops falling.[return][return]I was instantly grappled by this novel, which follows the lives of a handful of characters as they become more and more intertwined. Navigating in turn grief, boredom, lust, coming of age and raw guilt, each story is told with great sensibility and detail, slowly building the wider narrative, which grows progressively darker until the final climax. The result is a fascinating tale of loss and aching. A family ripped apart by a fatal accident, teenage angst, lust and love, the banal horrors of everyday life are soon replaced by more threatening elements, signs that Rosson's version of 1983 might be a bit different than the one from our memories.[return][return]As much as I enjoyed the dark side stories, I couldn't help but feel a bit disappointed by the main plot. The major story twist that is happening towards the end of the book could have been strong enough on its own without the extra supernatural and alternate history elements of the final chapters. But aside from this minor weakness, this is a strong story, of a quality that I've never before seen in the titles I've reviewed for the Early Reviewers program. I'm looking forward to more titles by this author.",

It very convincingly highlights the issues introduced by a little-known clause of international trade treaties, Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS), a supranational \"arbitration\" mechanism that allows a corporation to file a complaint against a country if a change in legislation \"unfairly\" undermines past investments.[return][return]The fundamental flaws of this mechanism are succinctly described, as is evidence of the growing number of cases in which it is abused for the maximization of corporate profits, often at the expense of developing countries. An urgent, important read, about a topic that mainstream media never talks about and few politicians even seem to be aware of. Do your country (and the world) a favour and send a copy of this book to your elected representatives next time a treaty is being negotiated.",

As humanity struggles to survive, an attempt is made to regain control of the Shade by digging up a frozen research lab. As an expert in quantum computers, the narrator is part of the expedition. But his task is made harder by the fact that he is tetraplegic, and has to rely on an exoskeleton in order to function.[return][return]I found this novel to be enjoyable, with a good story and a coherent universe. Although it uses most of the usual tropes of post-apocalyptic literature, the unique position of the main character adds a welcome twist to the genre.[return][return]The version of the ebook that I received as part of the Early Reviewers program was missing the chapter markings.

I was wrong, as Chris Dolley does an excellent job recreating the lovable characters and frivolous atmosphere of the one with the fast-paced sleuthing of the second. Bertie Wooster becomes Reggie Worcester, consulting detective, flanked by the ever-tactful automaton Reeves. A handful of more steam-powered automata and \"prometheans\" spice up the story, enough to clearly depart from the original authors, yet not too much as to become overwhelming. The result is funny, brilliant, geeky, engrossing, and leaves the reader wanting for more! Plus, extra nerd cred for painting Edison as a distant malevolent creature.[return][return]I received a complimentary copy of this book through the Early Reviewers program, and this was my first foray into steampunk fan-fiction and the work of Chris Dolley. Hopefully this will not be my last, as I'm planning to read Reeves and Worcester's debut \"What Ho, Automaton!\" next.",

      "notes" : "This book is a treasure trove of anecdotes about the sometimes unexpected provenance of the staples in our pantries. That the tin can was developed as a response to Napoleon's desire to replace his army's plundering with a more stable form of sustenance is well established. But the military's role, if not in the invention, then in the massive implementation of food sterilization techniques, packaging and esoteric preparation techniques did not stop there.[return]Most chapters of this book read well, arranged in chronological order and cleverly prefaced with short tableaus of modern family life to outline the ubiquitousness of the products discussed in the book. Unfortunately, their quality is uneven, alterning between well-researched popular science essays and rather confusing strings of anecdotes. Maybe this book is best enjoyed like a packaged Meal, Ready to Eat (MRE): devour the snacks and the more appetizing bits, but skip the soggy sides. Unless you are really hungry.",

Fifteen years later, survivors of the flu pandemic that nearly wiped out humanity join a caravan that performs Shakespeare plays, because \"surviving is not enough\".[return][return]This novel reads well and I quite liked the idea of the Travelling Symphony, a troupe of musicians and comedians performing Shakespeare among the ruins of civilization. I also enjoyed the scenes set in Toronto, my current home. To me, the subplots around the characters and their relationships before and after the pandemic are the most interesting part of the novel. I found the post-apocalyptic world described by Mandel to be much less believable than those of e.g. Edan Lepucki and Kim Stanley Robinson. Notably, I couldn't help but be irritated by survivors who, nearly twenty years after \"the end of civilization\" are still living in fast food joints, gas stations and tents set up in the middle of an airport terminal while leaving millions of empty houses abandoned. This reads more like a weak plot to highlight the contrast between survival after the catastrophe and the life of plenty that we took as granted, and less like a well-researched, plausible anticipation. The absence of any attempt to keep some of the pre-catastrophe technology working (other than guns) is also unnerving. Solar panels, anyone? Also, generators can run on something else than diesel.[return][return]In the end, these shortcomings, as well as the rather hollow ending, left me slightly disappointed, and yearning for a truly believable (and thus much more sobering) post-apocalyptic novel.",

Unfortunately, the WWII plans that are mentioned in the title are not treated in more detail than the other anecdotes, which is disappointing given the book's title.

His engineering knowledge comes in handy as he reorganizes the martian station, originally planned for a short stay only, to sustain his life while NASA tries one harebrained plan after another to come and rescue him. The novel comes close to what every science fiction book should be: plausible, well-researched science, relatable characters, page-turning action. Sadly, it doesn't avoid the usual pitfalls of the genre either, such as sexist gallows humour and the common deification of the white male american rule-bending hero. Fortunately, since social aspects play here a decidedly second role behind the intricate science and engineering of survival, the novel remains enjoyable all the way to the end. A good nerdy read.",

In his book, Ellard explores that relationship by focusing on different emotions (comfort, desire, fear, awe, etc.). Although natural landscapes and early human settlements are mentioned in passing, the modern urban environment is Ellard's main focus.[return][return]The book serves the dual purpose of presenting Ellard's own research results, and providing the state of the art on the psychogeography of cities by citing other studies and authors. It is therefore aimed both to the general public interested in the topic and to scholars. This is a difficult endeavour, and Ellard is careful to balance rigor with enjoyable reading, with unequal results. Some chapters read well, and are enjoyable to the layperson, while others are more dry and hard to follow. Unfortunately, the book starts with a rather dry chapter, which can dampen the reader's enthusiasm. Plowing through is rewarding, however, as the text is replete with fascinating examples ofthe intended and, often, unintended effects the built environment has on its inhabitants.[return][return]Nevertheless, I would recommend this book to anyone that is interested in psychogeography, and particularly urban planners, designers and architects intent on better understanding our relationship to the city.",

Supernatural elements turn out to be quite banal fabrications while sound science reveals dark Lovecraftian mysteries. Literal references abound, historical figures mix with complete fabrications and recurring characters predictably turn out where they're the least expected. Somber historical events are treated lightly but with respect. I don't often laugh out loud when I read, but this one had me giggling on my subway seat. Truly genius.",

In this fascinating memoir, he draws a parallel between programming languages and the intricate grammatical rules of Sanskrit, which arguably played an instrumental role in the establishment of the algorithmic principles that eventually evolved into computer instructions. Although the first chapters on the principles and history of coding are brilliantly eloquent - as is the very convincing critic of the inherent machismo of the IT community - the rest of the book quickly evolves into a rather dense discussion of literature aesthetics. And eventually leads to a bittersweet conclusion: code is code, it ultimately exists for a purpose. The intrinsic elegance of a computer program will only be perceptible by a very select group of human beings, as in, arguably, literature. But that is all right, for the true beauty both of a computer program and a good book lies more in how if affects the life of the user/reader than in arcane language rules. Who can object to that after a hundred pages of Sanskrit theory?",

Starting with a First Nation map drawn on birchbark and the first European map of the area, the Huron Map drawn by a French explorer in 1641 to a contemporary satellite image, carefully researched maps portray the history of the city in a uniquely visual way. Although most maps speak to themselves, they are accompanied by just the right amount of text to place them into context. The author is also thankfully generous in his definition of what a map is, allowing him to use birds eye views, drawings and photographs to better illustrate the transformation of the city.[return][return]New to the city myself (and, admittedly, rather a map geek too), I have learned a great deal just by browsing this excellent book. Names, geographical features, road layouts make much more sense to me now that I learned how they came to be. For example, I realized that a street in my neighborhood called \"Indian Road\" is so named because it follows an ancient path used by the Mississauga Nation long before the first settlers came to the shores of Lake Ontario. As the settlement, then the city grew, it spread its network of roads around this ancient path, connecting modern urban design with age-old wisdom. It's easy to forget how much a city grows organically. Studying historical maps is a great way to bring that fact back to life.",

Unfortunately, the novelty wears thin after the first few hundred pages, and it soon becomes quite hard to follow the plot. This, and the absence of a proper closure chapter at the end left me with too many unanswered questions to properly enjoy this book. Thriller readers want closure, the ability to understand the plot at the end, an opportunity to compare notes with what they had already found out by themselves and a last chance to grasp plot details that they might have overseen. No such luck here. I found myself still wondering what was the exact connection between the many stories interwoven in this book, and the motives for many of the characters actions still elude me.[return][return]Still, it was a good read, one of those thrillers you just can't put away.

After driving by its sign several times, intrigued (I'm new in town), I researched where the name came from and learned that until 2005, that road led to a large Kodak film manufacturing plant. Of the once sprawling industrial complex, only one building remains standing today. The dilapidated shell of the former Kodak employee centre is a striking reminder of how sudden the death of analogue photography came.[return][return]A professor at Ryerson University in Toronto and an experienced photographer, Robert Burley lived the global demise of the film giants firsthand. The Disappearance of Darkness is the result of a decade spent documenting the end of an era. From Kodak Heights in Toronto, Burley traveled the world to fixate - on photographic film - the remains of a once formidable industry. To any photographer, his impeccable, almost clinical images are both a delight in exposing an industrial process that used to be veiled in secrecy, and a distressing reminder that this very secrecy means that an immense body of knowledge was irremediably lost in the rapid dismantlement of film-processing plants... [return][return]Burley invites the reader to reflect on the past but doesn't limit himself to a nostalgic backward glance. Photography is not dead, it has evolved. Photographic film is not dead either, it moved from a mass staple to a niche product. This is a good book, and all good books end with a message: that of putting it back on the shelf after reading, going out, and taking a few more photographs.",

It also provides a nice background into the history of the telephone, and the evolution of its network in the USA.[return][return]While I enjoyed learning more about early telephone technology and the almost mythical phone phreaks that were the ancestors of computer hackers, I still found this book a bit tedious to read, especially after the first two thirds or thereabouts.

However, do not expect a self-help book: this is a dry sociology essay and therefore, it is rather dull to the casual reader... I, for one, was largely disappointed by this book because I was hoping to find confirmation for my personal reluctance to competition in all aspects of life. Instead, I found myself struggling to keep interested in the text.[return][return]The book starts quite tantalizingly with the realization that Danes report being much happier than Americans, while also displaying a cultural reluctance to competition. One would therefore expect the rest of the essay to explore the all-American winning culture with a critical approach. Instead of that, the text goes on into an incredibly tedious dissection of the various aspects of competition, heaping meaningless examples on top of apparent common sense. Only in the concluding chapter does the author come back to its initial comparison with Denmark, acknowledges the apparent contradiction and even goes so far as to propose three alternate approaches that could bring Americans closer to happiness without forfeiting their love for the Super Bowl.[return][return]As far as I was concerned, the first and last chapters were the only ones of interest in this book. Even then, I didn't find the concluding suggestions for a happier life exactly Earth-shattering either. In a nutshell, we would all be better off by a) practicing \"conceptual hygiene\", that is using the language of winning only when pursuing victory at something and avoiding it when comparing ourselves with others. Then we could also start realizing that b) the way really is the goal and that the process of achieving something the right way matters more than the actual result. Finally, we might as well c) ensure that we only engage in activities that \"satisfy our true and genuine drives and needs\". Now you tell me.[return][return]Maybe it was my Swiss upbringing talking (very close to the Danish Jante's Law in that it convinced me that under no circumstance I was to consider myself better than anyone else), but I very vividly remembers applying those exact three principles when arguing with my sports teacher that being last didn't matter to me in the slightest and that I really preferred to leisurely walk around the soccer field rather than waste my energy running...",

His sobering accounts on peer pressure within the scientific community, the desperate need for scholars to \"publish or perish\" and their understandable bias towards high-profile experiments that are tied to large funding budgets are certainly accurate and resonate well with my own experience as a researcher (not in physics, I hasten to add). However, I found the text somewhat hard to follow. Complex theories are explained in an off-hand style that assumes a prior understanding of the main concepts. Furthermore, the silly anecdotes and raging anti-establishment rants that permeate the text are very distracting. The result is quite a laborious read. A shorter essay, concentrating on the most prominent theoretical shortcomings would have been much more efficient, in my opinion.",

He's not a hipster, he's just the \"hipless boy\", caught between two relationships and coming to terms with his (occasionnally cross-dressed) life as a graphic artist. The stories in this collection are short insights in Sully's mostly uneventful life, pranks and conversations with his colorful friends Minerva the bisexual private-school dropout and Owen the happenings artist.[return][return]Apart from the truly gorgeous illustrations, what redeems all these relatively flat stories is the subtile way in which they touch on deeper, broader subjects, such as sexual identity, coming of age, social inequity or even teenage suicide. Intimist, sweet and a delight to the eyes, Sully's stories leave the reader with a desire to read more.",

Readers that might not feel the need to implement all of the DAM protocols outlined in this book will nevertheless profit from the insights on backup, disk arrays, duplicates management and metadata.[return]My review is based on the second edition of this book (May 2009), which has obviously been updated to cover more recent software, and therefore solve most of the issues that have been pointed out in older reviews. Specifically, references to iView have been updated with MS Expression Engine and there is broad coverage of Lightroom-based workflows.",

Sadly, it is also a road much traveled in contemporary graphic fiction, and Debbie Drechsler's slightly caricatural style does not match the finesse of other authors such as Craig Thomson or Alison Bechdel.

Predictions are everywhere in our lives: we choose mates, jobs, our clothes in the morning, a school for our children based on our possibly poorly informed, influenced yet usually overly confident forecasts. And of course, there are those who make a living out of predicting the weather or the evolution of the stock market (and then bet somebody else's money). Nate Silver very efficiently proves that nearly every prediction we make is flawed because we mistake noise for signal, dismiss low probabilities as \"impossibilities\" and tend to prefer listening to over-confident forecasters rather than cautious ones. It is a vital reality check: this book should be mandatory reading to every professional forecasters, especially economists and policy makers.[return]It is a very dense text, though. The theory is very well explained and expertly illustrated, but there remains an awful lot of it. I also had trouble with the arcane baseball terminology that is used repeatedly to illustrate key concepts. Whereas all other examples are nicely introduced to help the reader understand, a prior knowledge of baseball seems to be a prerequisite for this book...

From the intoxication of Lot by his incestuous daughters to the Last Supper, wine plays an important, generally positive, role. But what wine would Jesus drink? The authors of \"Divine Vintage\" have set out to answer that question, by exploring biblical quotations and reviewing the history of wine (and beer) in and around Palestine.[return][return]Sadly, what sounds like an interesting topic is watered down, so to speak, by a tiresome rambling style. The first chapters of the book are even less structured than the rest, thick with Biblical quotes and a jagged logical progression. The historical aspects of winemaking are more interesting, but are frustratingly short and imprecise, while the tasting notes that conclude the book will provide little information to readers that will unlikely get the opportunity to encounter wine coming from obscure israeli wineries.[return][return]This book has potential, with an interesting subject and written by two authors with an undisputed knowledge in theology and wine tasting. Unfortunately, one feels that the publisher utterly failed in his editorial duties: not only is the book written in an awkward and unequal style, but gross typos and inexactitudes have been left over: \"vine\" and \"wine\" are often mixed up, units jump from imperial to metric when they have not been entirely forgotten, even God's name is not consistently spelled YHWH, even though the authors lengthily insist on this at the beginning of the book.

Stop Forgetting to Remember fits exactly in that category: comics author Walter Kurtz, about to become a father, reflects on his past life as a geeky, pot-smoking teenager. As usual, most stories gravitate on his romantic failures and the inevitable discovery of the fairer sex (or, rather, sexes in that case). Thankfully, the author's broody recollections are offset by his present-day life as a new father, offering a positive, future-oriented outcome.

He advocates novel ways to measure library performance, in analogy to the manufacturing industry, and to think above the usual departmental barriers.

Unfortunately, it is neither informative nor entertaining: experiments follow each other in what seems like a hastened a posteriori justification, the case studies are colourless and the \"indubitable proofs\" Belbin offers to his theory turn out to be nothing but half-baked empirical descriptions. The only objective evidence would have been the actual numbered results of his experiments, but these are carefully hidden in two undocumented, barely readable figures (the only two figures in the whole book)!

This witty anthology goes beyond the classic \"men who cook\" (either chefs or fair-weather dads whose sole contribution is lighting up the BBQ on Sunday) and plunges right into the flour-covered lives of men who shop for groceries, plan dinners, chop veggies and tell their children how to hold a colander.[return][return]That we are not alone out there is already a refreshing thought, but this book goes much farther by being utterly entertaining and informative. Each invited author contributes a few of their key cookbooks and, of course, unveil some of their prized recipes. Even though some stories tend to corroborate the usual cliché of \"stunt-cooking\" men with large amounts of virile meat and grunted fishing tales, most are more sensible and together give a fairly broad overview of the many styles of cooking. Utterly delicious.",

Could this discrepancy reveal a not-so-subtle hidden agenda?[return]In any case, it is still an entertaining read, although what made the first Freakonomics original is starting to wear off.",

      "notes" : "If anything, this book is a good overview of the globalized economy in 2010. Whether we like it or not, our world has grown utterly dependent on air freight and travel, with vast quantities of passengers and goods revolving around the urban planning nightmares we usually call 'airports'. Kasarda's theory is that we should stop considering the airport as an ugly but necessary extension to a city and start seeing the airport as the de facto city centre.[return]The book is well-written, but lacks a clear logic between the chapters. Which are often too long and end up a bit boring. After the first chapters, I almost dismissed the book as a tarmac-happy, idealized vision of a boundless global economy, with no second thoughts about environmental or social costs. Thankfully, the second half of the book do address these issues, with some interesting insights on why calculating the carbon footprint of air travel isn't as easy as one might think.[return]Still, I always hated airports and probably always will do. For some reason, Kasarda's \"idyllic\" vision of a gigantic airport surrounded by a Sim City-like mix of commercial and residential areas, where shopping malls and golf courses supposedly suffice in making the inhabitants of such an artificial landscape feel at home, fails to resonate with me... I live 50km away from the nearest airport and I'm very happy about it.",

For my part, I wasn't aware of the magnitude of the situation, and was thus horrified to learn that such a minime proportion of meat produced in the US comes from sensible husbandry. Still, the book remains very US-centric and it would be interesting to know about the situation in other parts of the world. In Switzerland where I live, for example, it is relatively easy to find top-quality, locally and familiy produced meat, if you are ready to shell out a little bit more than for supermarket fare. And thus I have no problems being a \"selective omnivore\", eating mostly vegetarian food and occasionnaly indulging in a good piece of meat.[return][return]To get back to the US situation, the conclusion I'm personnaly drawing after reading JSF's book is that the real problem is that there is virtually no legislation to control meat production, and that is extremely worrisome. The \"solution\" to this problem is probably not a handful of well-educated people going vegetarian, but a real political uprising to demand stricter governement control. And also a decrease in the consumption of cheap meat by the population at large, but this book will probably fail to reach the people most in need of education on these matters. One good thing about this book is that it at least gets people talking. Just look at the reviews on LT...",

They were never seen again.[return]Two decades later, the found boy, now a detective within the Murder Squad, comes back to the same woods to investigate another gruesome case: the body of a little girl has been found at the very spot where his mates disappeared. Predictably, the investigation soon brings up disturbing memories of his childhood trauma and ends up shattering everything that's been holding him together, including the precious life-long friendship with his partner within the Squad, Cassie.[return]Warning: this multilayered thriller will hold your breath at the end of every chapter and will be hard to put down once started. A true masterpiece of the genre, with a psychological depth rarely found in crime fiction. A must read!",

There, they start a new life of explorations: of the flat itself, London, their own relationship with one another, and some disturbing family secrets. Not to mention the neighboring cemetery, of course... and its sweet, tea-drinking, welcoming guides, one of whom turns out to have been their aunt's lover and is actually living in the same house as them. But why haven't they met him earlier? Why are all windows of the upper flat sealed up? Who will catch the Kitten of Death? Where are Aunt Elspeth's missing diaries? And by the way, is she *really* dead?[return][return]This is a ghost story like you've never read before, it's delightful, original and witty, with exceedingly sympathetic characters. Yet it somewhat lacks the deepness and spark of utter genius that the \"Time Traveller's Wife\" has, making this a 3.5 star novel only because the comparison with Nyffenegger's masterpiece is hard to match :)",
